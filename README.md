I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a strong foundation in **JavaScript** and **React**. I specialize in building dynamic, high-performance web applications that focus on user experience, scalability, and maintainability. Over the years, I've honed my skills through various projects, from creating single-page applications (SPAs) to working on full-stack solutions.

I'm currently diving deeper into cybersecurity to expand my knowledge of secure coding practices, vulnerability assessment, and threat mitigation strategies. I aim to blend my software development skills with security best practices to build resilient, secure web applications.


## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, Python (learning)
- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Styled Components, Sass
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Other Tools**: Webpack, Babel, Jest, ESLint, Postman, Docker (learning)

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Interests

- Learning **ethical hacking** and **penetration testing** techniques.
- Understanding **OWASP** guidelines and integrating them into my development workflow.
- Exploring **network security** concepts and how to prevent vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection.
- Following best practices for **secure coding** and **data protection**.
